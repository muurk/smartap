# Community

Resources and guidelines for community participation.

## Get Involved

### GitHub

The primary hub for development and discussion:

**Repository:** [github.com/muurk/smartap](https://github.com/muurk/smartap)

- :material-source-branch: [Source code](https://github.com/muurk/smartap)
- :material-bug: [Issue tracking](https://github.com/muurk/smartap/issues)
- :material-forum: [Discussions](https://github.com/muurk/smartap/discussions)
- :material-git: [Contribute code](https://github.com/muurk/smartap/pulls)

### Home Assistant Community

Active discussion thread with long history:

**Thread:** [Smartap Shower Control - Getting Started with Reverse Engineering](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/smartap-shower-control-getting-started-with-reverse-engineering-a-smart-home-device/358251)

- Hardware photos and documentation
- Early reverse engineering discussions
- Community support
- Integration ideas

## Communication Channels

### GitHub Discussions

**[github.com/muurk/smartap/discussions](https://github.com/muurk/smartap/discussions)**

The best place for questions, ideas, and community interaction:

| Category | Use For |
|----------|---------|
| **Q&A** | Setup help, troubleshooting, "how do I..." questions |
| **Protocol Research** | Share captured messages, discuss byte patterns, coordinate research |
| **Ideas** | Feature suggestions, integration ideas, future directions |
| **Show and Tell** | Share your working setup, success stories, photos |
| **Announcements** | Project updates, releases (maintainers) |

**Why Discussions instead of Issues?**

- Issues are for actionable bugs and feature requests
- Discussions are for questions, ideas, and conversation
- Keeps the issue tracker focused and manageable
- Better threading for back-and-forth conversation

### GitHub Issues

**[github.com/muurk/smartap/issues](https://github.com/muurk/smartap/issues)**

For specific, actionable items:

- :material-bug: Bug reports (something is broken)
- :material-lightbulb: Feature requests (specific, well-defined features)
- :material-file-document: Documentation issues (errors, unclear sections)
- :material-code-tags: Code problems (build failures, test failures)
